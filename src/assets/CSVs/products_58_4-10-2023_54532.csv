This software provides a great upgrade from any standalone style DVR or other PC based recorder, providing you with the ability to see your video in real-time from anywhere with enterprise-grade software.  </p> 			<h3>Easy Video Playback</h3> 			<p>One of the best features of the AVM&nbsp;software, is the playback searching capabilities, which allows you to <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">scan through days of video visually in 15 seconds</span> to find a specific event.  Most DVRs provide only the ability to playback if you know exactly what time something happened.  Our AVM&nbsp;suite of software for analog, HD-SDI&nbsp;and HD IP cameras goes light-years further, providing you with true access to your video, and making the entire system more worthwhile.  With most systems, users dread having to playback the video, because it takes hours - so they only use it when something major happens.  Our customers with AVM use video constantly, because it takes no time at all, see what time employees came in to work, find your lost keys and much, much more..</p> 			<h3>FREE! - Remote Software Setup</h3> 			<p>Each of our AVM DVR cards comes with free remote setup and configuration of the AVM&nbsp;software too!  This means, you just call our technicians, and we will connect into your PC to setup the AVM&nbsp;software for recording and even configure your internet connection to setup the remote access on your phones and remote computers.</p> 			<h3>Easy Upgrades and Expansion!</h3> 			<p>Add more cameras to your system at any time, by combining another AVM8 CCTV DVR card, HD4 HD-SDI DVR Card, or adding HD IP Licenses to allow a true Tri-brid arrangement for recording.  With the AVM system, your security cameras are future-proof!  You can always expand and add newer technology cameras while still making use of your older CCTV cameras.  Traditional Standalone Style DVRs do not permit this capability.</p> 		<h3>Great Upgrade for existing CCTV&nbsp;Cameras</h3> 			<p>Our AVM&nbsp;DVR&nbsp;Cards are an excellent choice for upgrading older, obsolete Standalone DVRs, like those provided by many discount brands (QSee, Lorex, NightOwl, etc).   These AVM DVR&nbsp;cards install into a Windows 7 or 8.1 PC and will take the place of the Standalone DVR, recording with better quality, framerate and especially remote viewing and playback than your previous recorder.  All traditional analog CCTV cables will plug into this card for recording.

Our AVM&nbsp;suite of software for analog, HD-SDI&nbsp;and HD IP cameras goes light-years further, providing you with true access to your video, and making the entire system more worthwhile.  With most systems, users dread having to playback the video, because it takes hours - so they only use it when something major happens.  Our customers with AVM use video constantly, because it takes no time at all, see what time employees came in to work, find your lost keys and much, much more..</p> 			<h3>FREE! - Remote Software Setup</h3> 			<p>Each of our AVM DVR cards comes with free remote setup and configuration of the AVM&nbsp;software too!  This means, you just call our technicians, and we will connect into your PC to setup the AVM&nbsp;software for recording and even configure your internet connection to setup the remote access on your phones and remote computers.</p> 			<h3>Easy Upgrades and Expansion!</h3> 			<p>Add more cameras to your system at any time, by combining another AVM16 CCTV DVR card, HD4 HD-SDI DVR Card, or adding HD IP Licenses to allow a true Tri-brid arrangement for recording. With the AVM system, your security cameras are future-proof! You can always expand and add newer technology cameras while still making use of your older CCTV cameras. Traditional Standalone Style DVRs do not permit this capability.</p> 		<h3>Great Upgrade for existing CCTV&nbsp;Cameras</h3> 			<p>Our AVM&nbsp;DVR&nbsp;Cards are an excellent choice for upgrading older, obsolete Standalone DVRs, like those provided by many discount brands (QSee, Lorex, NightOwl, etc).   These AVM DVR&nbsp;cards install into a Windows 7 or 8.1 PC and will take the place of the Standalone DVR, recording with better quality, framerate and especially remote viewing and playback than your previous recorder.  All traditional analog CCTV cables will plug into this card for recording.

One thing we hear over and over from our clients with our AVM system, is that they have had camera systems in the past, and they dreaded using them because playback took hours or even days to review and find what they were trying to play.  With their AVM system, they are able to find the video in a matter of seconds by visually scanning through the archive with their mouse in order to find out what happened during the day.  Once you have used AVM for playback, you will never go back to another DVR again.  Faster video access and visual scanning makes your business camera system more useful as not only for security but also as a management tool.  See everything your employees did during the day so that you can make better management decisions, track customers through your business to better staff or even setup your retail displays.

The lightweight aluminum camera housing with polycarbonate dome allows these cameras to mount to any drywall or suspended (drop ceiling) with ease. While these cameras are IP66 rated for outdoor use, generally we recommend our HD-8xx7 or HD-9xx7 model cameras for outdoor use in the elements, as they have improved flat glass lenses instead of the polycarbonate included on this dome.</p><p>This camera delivers night vision with its built-in IR LEDs, so that the camera can see in complete darkness up to 65' maximum. Combined with a mechanical IR cut filter, which automatically slides across to filter IR light during the daytime, which helps to provide beautiful, true colors during daytime hours, while still delivering great IR night vision in black and white during evening hours.

These cameras deliver 4 MegaPixel real time video streaming (2688x1520) at smooth 20FPS. This camera takes that even further with a true auto-focus electronic 2.7-12mm motorized lens, which allows you to deliver a wide field of view when needed (up to ~110°)&nbsp;or a zoom view when required (down to ~30°).  Unlike many zoom style cameras, this camera has a true auto-focus lens that will automatically adjust (not a memorized stepped focus) for clearer, crisper images.</p> 			<p>The HD-9447 model camera is our latest 7th generation HD&nbsp;IP&nbsp;Camera, building on previous technologies to deliver better picture quality, this camera comes fully loaded with exceptional features, including true 120dB WDR, PoE, Electronic Zoom, 3D Noise Reduction, Array type SMART&nbsp;IR&nbsp;LEDs with up to 150' night vision, adjustable IR cut filter and video analytics, all housed in an IP66 rated weatherproof armored bullet housing.</p> 			<p>In order to deliver the optimum quality night vision, this camera combines an extremely low light 0.01 Lux CMOS image sensor with true Wide Dynamic Range (WDR)&nbsp;and a fully adjustable IR&nbsp;cut filter and SMART&nbsp;IR&nbsp;array LEDs.  These features all combine to provide the clearest, brightest picture even in complete darkness up to 150' away in complete darkness.  The true wide dynamic range helps brighten up darker areas of the picture to compensate for backlight conditions, and more importantly to boost darker areas at night.  Unlike digital wide dynamic that uses gamma adjustment to boost darker areas and produces more static or noise, this camera has true WDR that combines long and short exposure times to combine into a single frame with optimum clarity in all areas of the picture.  The completely adjustable IR&nbsp;cut filter allows you to set the lighting threshold to begin allowing IR light into the image sensor, as well as the delay time to reduce or eliminate ""stutter"" that is common with IR&nbsp;cut filters.  Possibly the best night vision feature of the HD-9447 camera, is the powerful SMART Array LEDs, which brighten and dim illumination dependent on the scene to deliver the best quality and coverage.  These powerful array type LEDs can deliver night vision in complete darkness even up to 100 feet.</p> 			<p>The bullet design housing is optimal for night vision, as it has a completely isolated glass cover, preventing IR light from reflecting back into the lens.  This fixes the problem that exists in many IR dome cameras, where bleed-over IR&nbsp;light can reflect around in the lens and wash out the image.</p> 			<p>This camera is very easy to connect, with built-in PoE (Power over Ethernet)&nbsp;support.

This allows you to record from all of your cameras not only to the HDVR, but also to other laptops and PCs over the internet, effectively backing up all of your video in real time.  With an off-site storage of video as well, you will have faster access to the recorded video, but also a redundant backup of all video off-site.  This is a superior method to video storage than limited cloud-type arrangements offered by competition, because your video is secure on your own PCs.  It also provides a better framerate, quality and resolution to cloud type options.</p> 			<div class=""c""></div> 			<hr class=""w80 g""> 		 			  			<h4>Ultimate Security</h4> 			<h5>Know even if someone TRIES to access your cameras</h5> 			<div class=""c""></div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Login_Alert.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""> 			<p><br><br><br> 				With most camera systems, you are never really sure who is watching your video.

Today's embedded IoT devices are the main target of hackers, because their simple programming and architecture is more easily hacked than today's computers. This is why embedded NVRs, DVRs and IP cameras are the main security hole in networks in the past few years. For this reason, we recommend never exposing an IP camera to the outside internet directly, and always recommend using our AVM systems instead of embedded devices for recording. Embedded devices with P2P or ""cloud-based"" remote access, leave gaping holes in your network that can not only allow someone access to your video, but also to your network in general.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>See in the Dark</h4><h5>See what happens even when there is no light</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Standalones/DVR-98xx/DVR-98xx-6.jpg"" alt=""4K IP cameras with extreme infrared night vision and WDR"" border=""0""><p><br><br>Often, what happens at night is more important to you than what happens during the daylight. This is why each of the included 4K cameras include infrared night vision that will illuminate the area in front of the cameras to allow the camera, and ultimately you to see even if there is no lighting outside. This light allows these cameras to see even in complete darkness up to 100' depending on model. The bullet and turret style cameras are the best selection for outdoor night vision due to their separated glass lenses which isolate the infrared and lens. This prevents bleedover from the IR into the lens.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Stay in touch with Alerts!</h4><h5>Motion Email &amp; Text Alerts, Alarm Integration and MORE</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Alerts.jpg"" alt=""Receive alerts based on sensors with our optional alarm module"" border=""0""><p><br><br>Our 4K HD IP systems also support an optional alarm input interface card which can enable the system to arm or disarm your alarm system, or provide alerts based on individual sensors.

The AVM software is compatible with virtually all IP cameras manufactured, including Platinum CCTV cameras, HIKVision, Dahua, Axis, ACTi, Vivotek and many more. This NVR recorder is also compatible with generic ONVIF IP cameras as well. When deciding on hardware for your home or business security camera system, it is important to know that the NVR recorder is the most important part of the system. The NVR determines the features and functionality of your camera system.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Find your video in seconds not hours!</h4><h5>Fastest access to video means you use your cameras more!</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Playback.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Our MidNVR recorders include our latest AVM (Advanced Video Management) software for IP camera recording. This software allows industry-leading access to your recorded video, allowing you to scan through days, weeks or months of video visually to find exactly what happened in a matter of seconds instead of hours. This single feature alone makes the NVR recorder worth more than other recorders on the market. Our customers use their security camera footage for more than just a break-ins or vandalism. They now can use their video to see everything that happened in the course of a day in a matter of seconds. This may not be the only feature of this system that makes it better than the rest, but it is certainly one of the most important.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Real-Time Remote Camera Access</h4><h5>View cameras from all your devices</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/Remote_Access.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Our home and business systems have been accessible from cell phones from long before the first iPhone was released. We even had the ability to watch security cameras back in the days of the flip phone. As technology evolved, so did our capabilities for remote access. We were one of the first to allow security camera footage from an iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Symbian phone and more. This allows our clients a highly-evolved and advanced level app that permits them to see everything that is happening in real-time from anywhere in the world.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Support for all Major IP Cameras</h4><h5>Compatible with most IP camera brands/models</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM-IP-Cameras.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br><br>This MidNVR with AVM is compatible with virtually every brand IP camera on the market, as well as generic cameras through ONVIF and RTSP protocols. Major brand IP cameras like ACTi, Arecont Vision, Axis, Sanyo, Bosch, Platinum CCTV, Ganz, HIKVision, Dahua, Everfocus, Samsung and more are fully integrated into the software for easy installation and operation of the cameras. These cameras will stream securely into the AVM NVR, which records from the cameras, and serves the video up for remote access from PCs, MACs, tablets, Androids and iPhones.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Remote Video Recording</h4><h5>Keep backup copies of your video</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM-Remote-Record.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br>If you are worried that someone will break in and steal your video, worry no more. This AVM system comes complete with our CMS4 software, allowing you to conduct a remote recording over the internet to an off-site location automatically in real time. This is different from Cloud-based recording which is very limited in the bandwidth and resolution of main recording. With our AVM software, you can recording the primary full resolution or secondary reduced resolution remotely in real-time, allowing you to custom-tailor your offsite video to match the quality and bandwidth you require and have available. This means that you can always have a backup recording of all of your video, even if your recorder is stolen.

This generally happens with low-cost security camera options like embedded DVRs and NVRs. With our AVM system, it runs on the latest Windows 10 platform, allowing the latest in updated security features, while also offering thousands of times more processing capabilities than simple embedded NVRs. Our PC-based recording platforms can even be configured to let you know every time someone even attempts to access your security cameras. This way, you can receive a text message or email, even before access to your cameras has occured. This is far better security than offered by more simple NVR recorders. SSL encryption for video and login information now supported for even more security. Trust your indoor home or business security cameras to a system that lets you know what is happening all the time.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Stay in touch with Alerts!</h4><h5>Motion Text Alerts, Alarm Integration and MORE</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Alerts.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Integrate your home or business security camera system to a level you never even dreamed possible. Most security camera systems state that they can send you email or text alerts. The problem is that they issue alerts based on video motion (like RING, Nest, etc.) and these methods of alerting are prone to extreme false alerting which means that you will disable the alerts very quickly. Our AVM system is compatible with security cameras that have built-in VCA analytics events so that you can receive alerts only when a person or vehicle enters a certain area. These cameras, like our 7th Generation HD IP cameras, allow you to really receive intelligent alerting from your security camera system with complex schedules and events. If you want even more integration, then connect an alarm integration module to receive alerts and events when your alarm system is tripped, alarmed, etc. The base of a truly smart home or business is the brains. This MidNVR recorder with AVM software is the best platform to control and collect all of your information in one place. Our systems go far beyond simply traditional security cameras.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>POS System Integration</h4><h5>Optional POS System Integration for Businesses</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_POS.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Upgrade your security camera system to incorporate POS system integration. Our AVM system supports most POS systems, and allows you not only to view the transactions in real time as they are occurring, but also to search transactions based on clear text data. This is because the transaction information is stored inside a database, allowing you better control of how to search and find transactions. This is just another way our AVM system is capable of becoming a valuable asset to your business.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>More Powerful Scheduling</h4><h5>Control everything that happens</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_alarm.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br><br>Built into our AVM software, even the core of its operations is a powerful and flexible scheduling engine. This allows the software to work seamlessly with all of your business and home automation tasks. Schedule recording, events, alerts for motion or VCA events and much more with a complex scheduler that helps to ensure that you can receive alerts only when you deem them necessary. This scheduling capability ensures that you will always be able to reconfigure your system to suit your needs and lifestyle.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>An Expert on your shoulder</h4><h5>Industry Leading Technical Support</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Standalones/DVR-98xx/DVR-98xx-8.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br>Our technicians are highly trained and ready to assist you in the setup and operation of your system.

Elevated skin temperatures are often a sign of elevated body temperatures, making this a great tool to quickly identify those who need further screening prior to entering the facility. It is recommended to use this camera with the optional blackbody to provide a consistent temperature reference to aid in the speed and accuracy of skin temperature measurements. This camera is not a medical device and is not designed or intended to provide diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition. This solution is a screening tool that businesses and households can use to identify individuals with elevated skin temperatures compared to a customizable reference temperature (blackbody) while individuals are entering the facility. This camera provides temperature readings to ±0.3°C (±0.54°F) when used with backbody. This means that you are able to see on screen and receive visible light and/or audible alerts from your security camera system when persons with a high skin temperature is identified. This camera is the ideal addition to large businesses and public places where security screening occurs, as it allows security personnel to isolate persons who may be ill and may not even know it yet. With many viruses and other highly contagious diseases, a fever is often the first symptom and has been said to be an indicator of individuals who are contagious. Pre-screening for individuals with elevated skin temperatures can help identify those that should be screened further for fever (elevated body temperatures) by personnel using an FDA thermometer for individuals who appear to be outside of the normal skin temperature range. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size:90%; line-height:normal;"">This thermal camera is not designed or intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition.

Businesses are taking many different measures to try to help ensure the security of their clients and employees.

Early in the coronavirus pandemic, airports were clogged up with lines of people waiting for manual screening by security personnel with thermometers to screen indivduals for signs of a fever. These cameras improve the speed of these lines 100-fold by allowing for a rapid prescreening of all individuals as quickly as they can walk through, and it identifies people even if their faces are obscured by a mask. If individuals are identified that have a raised body temperature, then they can be separated from the rest for further screening by an FDA approved physical thermometer.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Police-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Police and first responders need a rapid way to screen individuals for elevated skin temperatures so that they can take proper precautions"" title=""From police checkpoints to jails, rapid screening of people will assist police in pre-screening individuals for symptoms"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Police and First Responders</span> will have many need to set up checkpoints and screening stations as life tries to return to normal. When used with the tripods and rapid deployment hardware, police and first responders can set up to pre-screen people for elevated skin temperatures as quickly as people can walk through a line. This makes any screening process much more efficient and saves more PPE (masks and gowns) because there is no contact with individuals as they walk past during the pre-screening process.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Hospitals-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Hospitals more than anyone need to have a way to quickly pre-screen individuals for elevated skin temperatures prior to entering"" title=""Fever detection cameras can be used in hospitals to identify persons who may be infected with viruses such as COVID-19 using body heat sensing cameras"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hospitals</span> have been overwhelmed with people that have and dont have symptoms and signs of the COVID-19 coronavirus during this pandemic.

These facilities were some of the first impacted by the spreading COVID-19 coronavirus because of the possible mass exposure. This shows that these facilities are going to be one of the worst impacted when it comes to the world moving forward in the aftermath of this pandemic to help prevent future problems. Contact-type screening for fevers of each person that enters the facility would take far too long, and could cause these facilities to stay closed for even longer. These facilities, more than most greatly benefit from the rapid pre-screening technology of these new thermographic cameras for elevated skin temperatures. With these cameras in place at each of the security checkpoints, all the patrons and employees can be rapidly scanned. These systems can be quickly deployed for temporary screening, or can be permanently mounted for ongoing usage. Once individuals are identified as having elevated skin temperatures from a thermographic camera, it is highly recommended that these individuals are futher screened for fever (elevated body temperatures) by personnel with an FDA-cleared thermometer prior to entering the facility. </p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Manufacturing-350x233.jpg"" alt=""Rapid pre-screening for elevated skin temperatures of individuals will help our supply chains stay open"" title=""Thermal imaging cameras will ensure that supply chains can stay in operation by identifying persons with viral symptoms"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Manufacturing Facilities, Transportation Hubs and Warehouses</span> are the backbone of the supply chains that are critical during times of pandemics.

This camera is not a medical device and is not designed or intended to provide diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition. This solution is a screening tool that businesses and households can use to identify individuals with elevated skin temperatures compared to a customizable reference temperature (blackbody) while individuals are entering the facility. This camera provides temperature readings to ±0.3°C (±0.54°F) when used with backbody. This means that you are able to see on screen and receive visible light and/or audible alerts from your security camera system when persons with a high body temperature are identified. This camera is the ideal addition to large businesses and public places where security screening occurs, as it allows security personnel to isolate persons who may be ill and may not even know it yet. With many viruses and other highly contagious diseases, a fever is often the first symptom and has been said to be an indicator of individuals who are contagious. This camera can help businesses pre-screen individuals as they enter a facility, and can follow up with temperature measurement using an FDA thermometer for individuals who appear to be outside of the normal body temp. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">This thermal camera is not designed or intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition.

Businesses are taking many different measures to try to help ensure the security of their clients and employees.

Early in the coronavirus pandemic, airports were clogged up with lines of people waiting for manual screening by security personnel with thermometers to screen indivduals for signs of a fever. These cameras improve the speed of these lines 100-fold by allowing for a rapid prescreening of all individuals as quickly as they can walk through, and it identifies people even if their faces are obscured by a mask. If individuals are identified that have a raised body temperature, then they can be separated from the rest for further screening by an FDA approved physical thermometer.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Police-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Police and first responders need a rapid way to screen individuals for fever so that they can take proper precautions"" title=""From police checkpoints to jails, rapid screening of people will assist police in pre-screening individuals for symptoms"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Police and First Responders</span> will have many need to set up checkpoints and screening stations as life tries to return to normal. When used with the tripods and rapid deployment hardware, police and responders can set up to screen people quickly for a fever as quickly as people can walk through a line.

This camera is not a medical device and is not designed or intended to provide diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition. This solution is a screening tool that businesses and households can use to identify individuals with elevated skin temperatures compared to a customizable reference temperature (blackbody) while individuals are entering the facility. This camera provides temperature readings to ±0.3°C (±0.54°F) when used with backbody. This means that you are able to see on screen and receive visible light and/or audible alerts from your security camera system when persons with a high body temperature are identified. This camera is the ideal addition to large businesses and public places where security screening occurs, as it allows security personnel to isolate persons who may be ill and may not even know it yet. With many viruses and other highly contagious diseases, a fever is often the first symptom and has been said to be an indicator of individuals who are contagious. This camera can help businesses pre-screen individuals as they enter a facility, and can follow up with temperature measurement using an FDA thermometer for individuals who appear to be outside of the normal body temp. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">This thermal camera is not designed or intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition.

Early in the coronavirus pandemic, airports were clogged up with lines of people waiting for manual screening by security personnel with thermometers to screen indivduals for signs of a fever. These cameras improve the speed of these lines 100-fold by allowing for a rapid prescreening of all individuals as quickly as they can walk through, and it identifies people even if their faces are obscured by a mask. If individuals are identified that have a raised body temperature, then they can be separated from the rest for further screening by an FDA approved physical thermometer.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Police-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Police and first responders need a rapid way to screen individuals for fever so that they can take proper precautions"" title=""From police checkpoints to jails, rapid screening of people will assist police in pre-screening individuals for symptoms"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Police and First Responders</span> will have many need to set up checkpoints and screening stations as life tries to return to normal.

These facilities were some of the first impacted by the spreading COVID-19 coronavirus because of the possible mass exposure. This shows that these facilities are going to be one of the worst impacted when it comes to the world moving forward in the aftermath of this pandemic to help prevent future problems. An antiquated contact-type screening for fevers would take far too long, and would cause these facilities to stay closed for even longer. These facilities, more than most would greatly benefit from the rapid fever scanning technology of these new body temperature scanning cameras. With these cameras in place at each of the security checkpoints, all the patrons and employees can be rapidly scanned. These systems can be quickly deployed for temporary screening, or can be permanently mounted for ongoing usage.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Manufacturing-350x233.jpg"" alt=""Rapid scanning of individuals for fever will help our supply chains stay open"" title=""Thermal imaging cameras will ensure that supply chains can stay in operation by identifying persons with viral symptoms"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Manufacturing Facilities, Transportation Hubs and Warehouses</span> are the backbone of the supply chains that are critical during times of pandemics.

This is why during the coronavirus pandemic, many of these facilities cut off all ties with the outside world. Unfortunately, still workers in many instances have become infected and brought the virus into the facility ultimately infecting many of the residents. Because an elevated body temperature is one of the earliest symptoms of many viruses, many of these facilities have implemented protocols to examine body temperatures of individuals as they enter the facility. Rapid pre-screening of visitors and employees entering the facility can be extremely useful in limiting exposure of the population to viruses such as th flu and more.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Car-Dealer-350x234.jpg"" alt=""Car Dealers have many customers entering facilities which can quickly and easily be scanned by body temp scanning cameras"" title=""Body temp scanning cameras will greatly help car dealers by allowing them to see if patrons have a fever before they enter vehicles"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Car Dealers</span> have great numbers of people cycling through to examine and even test drive the different vehicles.

Also built-in to this innovative camera, is facial detection technology that can optionally be employed to permit access only to individuals, or permit access based on IC access control card (must be used with access control devices and/or locks to prevent/deny access).</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Day-Spa-350x233.jpg"" width=""350"" alt=""Salons and Day Spas really benefit from thermal body temp cameras scanning for elevated skin temperatures and face masks on entry"" title=""Day Spa and salong Thermal body temp sensing camera with mask detection for access control to help prevent the spread of COVID-19"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spas and Salons</span> are one type of business that clearly will have many people coming through the doors, as post-lockdown in every country many of us need our haircuts and other services. These businesses will clearly get a great benefit by being able to scan the body temperature of each person as they are entering the building. In the case of these businesses, it is impossible to keep social distancing while delivering many of their needed services. This is why it is one of our most popular cameras for day spas, medical spas and salons that are trying to open back up after the end of stay-at-home orders and other quarnantine efforts in their locales. In some cases, spas are using these cameras to prevent access to the building (in conjunction with electric door locks in vestibule areas), in others it is used as a standalone device with the floor bracket to take temperatures and alert the person and receptionist if people are entering with a high body temperature. It is really nice to have the mask detection and reminder built-in to this camera as well, because it reduces the need to have employees reminding customers that they need to put on their mask.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Restaurant-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Restaurants and Bars clearly can benefit by being able to quickly take temperatures and see if masks are used during entry"" title=""Restaurant Body Temp sensing and mask detection camera for access control."" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Restaurants and Bars</span> also are an area that immediately benefit from these cameras. Many restaurants and bars already have vestibule areas that can easily be adapted to permit access only when people entering do not have an elevated skin temperature and can also provide a reminder or deny access to people who are not wearing a proper face mask. In the future, the mask requirement can be turned off easily when requirements for wearing masks in public are relaxed. Restaurants are all going to great lengths to be ready to open back up for customers to dine in, these thermal body temp measuring cameras with mask detection are the perfect way to add an easy and high tech way to comply with state and local recommendations, while ensuring that your patrons feel safe to return to your facility.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Hospitals-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Hospitals more than anyone need to have a way to quickly screen individuals for an elevated body temperature as people are entering"" title=""Doctor and Dentist office Body temp fever sensing camera with mask detection"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Doctors Office's and Dental Offices</span> are beginning to open up again around the world, and are looking for ways to not overwhelm their staff while showing their clients that they are doing everything they can to ensure the safety and health of their patients.

Elevated skin temperatures are often a sign of elevated body temperatures, making this a great tool to quickly identify those who need further screening prior to entering the facility. When used as recommended with the optional blackbody, this camera can deliver skin temperature readings accurate to ±0.3°C (±0.54°F). This camera is not a medical device and is not designed or intended to provide diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition. This solution is a screening tool that businesses and households can use to identify individuals with elevated skin temperatures compared to a customizable reference temperature (blackbody) while individuals are entering the facility. This camera provides temperature readings to ±0.3°C (±0.54°F) when used with backbody up to a maximum distance of 10 feet. When a person with elevated skin temperature is encountered by the camera, it provides an optional audible alert and flashing white LED to alert personnel on site that an individual may need further screening to determine if they have elevated body temperature and to enact facility security and sanitation protocols. Optionally, managers and key personnel can receive text, email and pop up video alerts through our optional AVM (Advanced Video Management) software or MicroNVR recorders.<br><br>This camera is a reduced thermal resolution version of our PT-BF5421 model camera, to provide a lower-budget solution for pre-screening skin temperatures at a reduced distance from the camera. For the PT-BF3221 model camera, it is recommended to place the blackbody and person being measured at a distance of 6 feet from the camera, as this camera can measure accurately only up to 10 foot distance (the PT-BF5421 model can measure up to 22 feet maximum). With the reduction of the thermal image sesor resolution, there is also a reduced width of view compared to the PT-BF5421, making this camera better for narrower entrances or areas where people can be funneled one at a time past the camera. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size:90%; line-height:normal;"">This thermal camera is not designed or intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition.

Rapid pre-screening of visitors and employees entering the facility for elevated skin temperatures can be useful in speeding up the entry process and limiting exposure of the population to individuals who may already be infected with viruses such as the flu. Once persons are identified with elevated skin temp, it is recommended that they be further screened for elevated body temperature by personnel with an FDA-cleared thermometer prior to allowing them to access the facility.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Car-Dealer-350x234.jpg"" alt=""Car Dealers have many customers entering facilities which can quickly and easily be pre-screened for entry by thermographic cameras"" title=""Body temp scanning cameras will greatly help car dealers by allowing them to see if patrons have a fever before they enter vehicles"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Car Dealers</span> have great numbers of people cycling through to examine and even test drive the different vehicles. With the new coronavirus and possible future viral threats, operations must change to keep all their employees and customers safe. One great way to accomplish this in a way that has minimal visual and time impact on clients and staff, can be the use of methods of screening individuals for elevated body temperatures. Our thermal cameras can be permanently mounted in entry ways so that they are barely even noticeable but can provide alerts with our AVM software to key personnel in the facility when elevated skin temperatures are detected, so that they can further screen and address the issue or take other precautions.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Apartments-350x233.jpg"" alt=""Apartment buildings and high rises can easily scan visitors and residents for elevated skin temps prior to entering the facility"" title=""Scan residents and visitors to apartments and condos with thermal cameras prior to entering the building where many could be exposed"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Apartment Buildings, Condos and High Rises</span> all have many people living in close proximity to one another, with common areas of contact.

This 1080P Full HD resolution camera comes equipped with an 8-32mm electronic motorized zoom lens to help custom-tailor the width of view for optimum license plate capture, DarkFighter Ultra-Low Light technology with headlight compensation capabilities and up to 300 foot infrared night vision. These cameras are a great addition to any business security camera system, providing you with excellent non-blurred high definition video to provide not only great license plate capture, but also details on vehicles that would be missed by other cameras due to higher vehicle speeds.</p><p>When it comes to IP security cameras, resolution is not the only factor that needs to be considered. In fact, when it comes to license plates on moving vehicles, often the higher resolution 2K (4MP) and 4K (8MP) cameras are not the best choice. These cameras have lower framerates, and have greater smearing than a specific license plate camera. While many 2K and 4K cameras may grab license plates when vehicles are stopped, once they pick up speed, often they do not function well.</p><p>This HD-LPR model license plate recognition camera provides great color video during the daytime at up to 30FPS, and then switches to black and white at night with infrared up to 300 feet. At night, the video from these cameras appear as a solid black screen, but when a vehicle passes through, it will see the headlights and license plate or tail lights and license plate. This is due to the fact that these cameras have to be tuned to reduce the overall brightness to prevent glare that occurs on most cameras when IR lights reflect off of US license plates.</p><p>These cameras include our 7th Generation video processing chip providing superior video quality with up to 16Mbps bit rate and up to 30FPS to provide blur free video coverage even on vehicles traveling up to 70 MPH.

This professional-grade IP camera has been deployed in many large warehouses, parking lots, security checkpoints, airports, power stations and other facilities where greater coverage and control is desired. </p><p> This camera also has built-in Intelligent Auto-Tracking capabilities, to allow the camera to follow motion when a vehicle or person enters the view of the camera. This means the camera can even control itself and follow a subject for a pre-determined amount of time prior to snapping back into its guard position. We always recommend using PTZ cameras as a supplement to a complete security camera system, not a replacement, that is because you don't ever want to lose what is happening behind the camera when you are moving it around. These cameras are powerful enough for larger business security coverage, but affordable enough for high-end home camera system installations as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 1080p Resolution HD-PTZ-2mAT PTZ&nbsp;camera features our 7th generation video processor for smooth, clear video processing and also features a 25x optical zoom lens with auto-focus capabilities.

These cameras have our new 8th generation video processing chip, providing clearer and smoother video than ever before, with the added capabilities of cross-line and intrusion detection with our new Human and Vehicle detection filters. This AI alone makes your security camera system responsive to your needs, even providing audible alerts and flashing white LED lights to alert trespassers they are being monitored, while also being able to combine with our AVM system to send alerts to you so you know someone is on your property.</p><p>The HD-8418AI camera comes with our 2K Resolution (4 MegaPixel) image sensor, with a new 8th generation video processing chip, allowing it to deliver higher framerate video (up to 30fps) at 2K resolution.

This reduces false alerting even further, so that you can rely on your cameras to alert you when there is something you need to see without the pesky false-alerts that other cameras deliver. This new filter can be employed to provide you with text or email alerts during certain times of day/days of the week when a vehicle or person enters an area they should not be in.</p><p>The HD-8418AI HD IP Camera can be enhanced with optional backbox for direct wall mount allowing cables to be conceiled, wall bracket for suspended installation or even pole mount for mounting it directly to a pole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Features</h3><p> This Feature-Rich SMART HD IP Turret camera delivers great quality video for home and business with advanced alerting capabilities.</p><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HD 2K Resolution Video quality</span> (2560x1440 Resolution) </li><li>4.0 MegaPixel CMOS Image Sensor </li><li>Enhanced A.I.

The IR filter can be automatically actuated by the built in optical sensor (default) or programmed to switch at a specific time, or remain in a predefined mode.</p><p>The HD-8819 HD IP Camera can be enhanced with optional backbox for direct wall mount allowing cables to be conceiled, wall bracket for suspended installation or even pole mount for mounting it directly to a pole.</p><p>We recommend our <a href=""https://platinumcctv.com/nvr-cctv.html"">NDAA Approved AVM NVR software or AVM NVR recorders </a>combined with these NDAA Approved IP cameras, as our AVM software is programmed to provide you the best features with the Deep-Learning A.I. capabilities that are built in to this camera.
