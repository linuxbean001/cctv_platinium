These problems don't just affect fast food franchises, but also high end restaurants alike.

While many search for a camera system because they want security, our clients find that when the system is designed properly and with the correct NVR recorder, the video is ultimately useful for much more.

This feature alone means that you can find your video fast, and get back about your day.  We know our clients don't want to waste their day trying to playback video.  That is why we designed a new NVR system from the ground-up 20 years ago, allowing our clients to spend less time, but get more value. 	<br><br> 	Our latest HD IP Smart Cameras even have AI built-in to make the searching even faster.

Our HD&nbsp;AVM&nbsp;security camera systems are an important upgrade for school security, providing crisp, clear, actionable video to help keep our children safe while under your care.  One of the most overlooked, yet important things about school security, is the easy access to recorded video.  Most systems require an administrator to go to the location of the recorder, and stand there for HOURS trying to find the important video.  I ask you, how useful is that?  	</p><p>Our AVM&nbsp;(Advanced Video Management)&nbsp;systems for schools of all sizes are changing the way we protect our children with security cameras. With our AVM&nbsp;systems, administrators can easily access the recorded and live video from their office, and can even scan through days of video watching visually for a specific event in SECONDS instead of hours.  This means school administrators can react to threats, violence  or other minor offenses immediately before the problem mushrooms.  These systems deliver easy access to video both locally and remotely.  Our systems are security cameras reimagined with full school security in mind.</p> 			<p>Older school systems can easily be upgraded to our new AVM&nbsp;system, simply contact us at 866-537-5438 for a custom quote</p> 			<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Enhanced Features Include:</span></p> 			<img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Playback_School.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""> 			<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Easy access to Playback</span><br> 				(<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Scan through days of video in 15 seconds or less</span>)</p> 			<ul> 				<li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Find important video in seconds </span>(every second counts when it comes to school incidents) 				</li><li>Provide evidence and actionable intelligence in seconds 				</li><li>Scan through video to quickly see students throughout the school 				</li><li>Identify and monitor trouble students with ease 				</li><li>Remotely playback video from office 				</li><li>Quickly see everything that happened in a matter of seconds	 			</li></ul> 			<div class=""c""></div><br><br> 				 				<img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Remote_School.jpg""> 			 			<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Enterprise-Grade Remote Access</span></p> 			<ul> 				<li>Secure REAL-TIME&nbsp;remote access to live video from				<ul> 					<li>iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Windows&nbsp;Phones  					</li><li>PC &amp; Mac  				</li></ul> 				</li><li>Playback video from your devices 				</li><li>Watch multiple schools in the district at once			</li><li>Built-in Remote Recording - Copy all video to District Office Automatically			</li></ul> 			<div class=""c""></div><br><br> 			 			<img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Motion_School.jpg""> 			<p><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">More Adjustable Motion Detection Recording</span></p> 			<ul> 					<li>9000 Different Levels of Motion Sensitivity (most have 5-10) 					</li><li>Configurable Masking Areas  				</li><li>Store More Video with Smaller Hard Drives 			</li></ul> 			 			<div class=""c""></div><br><br> 			<img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Alerts_School.jpg""> 			<p><br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Highly Secure Platform Protects Video and Personnel</span></p> 			<ul> 				<li>Fully Compatible with Secure VPN&nbsp;Networks 				</li><li>Text/Email alerts when unauthorized access is attempted  				</li><li>More secure access means your video is protected 				</li><li>Infinite user accounts with configurable access			</li></ul> 			 			<div class=""c""></div><br><br> 			<img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/Future_Proof.jpg""> 			<p><br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Easy Expansion </span>- Compatible with all camera types</p> 			<ul> 				<li>Easily add and incorporate traditional Analog CCTV&nbsp;Cameras, HD&nbsp;IP&nbsp;Cameras or HD-SDI&nbsp;(HD over Coax) cameras to improve coverage 				</li><li>System can be used with existing cameras as well!

This is often because security camera systems are not really helpful to corporate franchisors or stores, as they are too limited to provide in-depth business information.  Platinum CCTV™ has changed this with our AVM NVRs.  These innovative NVRs provide a ground-up redesign to the way our clients see their video cameras.  <b>Our AVM NVR systems treat video like data</b> as it should be.  	 	<br><br> 	The power of our AVM NVR systems starts with our combination of hardware and software.  Other vendors peddle many different varieties of the same standalone recorders or even 'cloud-based' solutions for almost the same cost as our NVRs.  These standalone NVRs and DVRs have very limited remote access and no discernable ability to use any of the data for better management.  'Cloud-based solutions' cannot keep up with the data due to limited upload speeds.  Even the most basic feature of our NVRs, allows our franchisees or corporate managers to <b>scan through days, weeks or months of video in a matter of seconds</b> even remotely over the internet.  This feature alone provides valuable data on the employees of the retail franchise and how they are doing their jobs, leading to better decisions on staffing, training and more. 	<br><br> 	The fast video playback and remote access are our oldest feature from 20 years ago, and competitors still have not yet caught up.  Our latest NVRs and software coupled with our AI cameras provide far more valuable data. This combination even allows you to <b>get counts of vehicles past the building on the street, heatmaps of traffic through the retail space for better merchandising and headcount of people through the doors.</b>   	</p> 	<h3>Better data always leads to better business.</h3> 	 	<br><br> 	<p>At Platinum CCTV™ <b>our NVRs treat video like business data</b>, so that you can manage your warehouse better, no matter the size.   	</p> 	 			 	<div class=bton><a  href=""/crm.asp?action=contactus""> 	Get a Quote Today 	</a></div> 	<div class=rh4> 		<h4 >Nationwide Installation Available*</h4> 	</div> 	<div class=c></div> 	<br> 	<hr class=b60> 	<br> 	<h4>Better Data = Better Business Decisions</h4> 	<p>Corporate retail chains need data.

However, this is not really what people want from their camera system.  Many systems claim to have this ability, but in reality it does not work properly.  This is because security camera systems rely on video motion to trigger an alert or event.  This means that anything that moves on the screen will send a text message, leading to extremely high level of false alerts.  You see, the motion detection capabilities of security camera systems are designed to record everything that happens with motion detection, to deaden the sensitivity of the motion detection to the point where there is no excess recording and no false alerts, would also mean that the system will not be recording some events that it should.  This is why alerts based on video motion, get shut off within minutes due to false alerts.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What people really want for their camera system, is to receive an alert when a person approaches their building, or a vehicle approaches the building.  <i>Our new SMART cameras deliver just this capability!</i></span>   </p>  <div class=""vidwrap""> <iframe class=""vid"" width=""700"" height=""394"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLqS0N8sNe7FVC3Vr4tMiN0zsFnNR4YFDq&amp;rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe> </div> <p> Each of our new SMART IP cameras integrate with our AVM (Advanced Video Management) system to deliver alerts only when the event you specify occurs.  These cameras perform calculations based on the size, shape and speed of an object to classify it on the screen, then waits until the object enters into your pre-defined zone.  Events can be based on objects entering, leaving, crossing a specific line, entering into a zone, or even waiting in a certain zone (dwelling) for a specified amount of time.  Once the event is triggered, it is passed to the AVM system, which can deliver a variety of alerts, such as popping a camera up to full screen, sending an email with picture, sending a text message, setting a bookmark in the archive and more.   </p> 			<p> With this new level of video analytics, your camera system can deliver what you truly want out of security cameras, but did not think was possible: Your camera system autonomously lets you know when important events are occurring so that you only need to watch when it tells you.

This new feature allows you to use current camera technology, together with the built-in OCR capabilities of the AVM software, to capture, read and log license plates in your security camera system so that you can call them up easily. Once logged into the database, the system takes a snapshot of the plate that was read, and can even be correlated with an owner, which will appear when the plate is captured in the future. Call up information and even see the video based on plates that you sesarch for in the system.</p><p>Extending your system to license plate capture can be done with virtually any security camera, but is best performed using a camera zoomed in on a pinch-point where vehicles must be forced to drive through to enter and/or exit your facility. For best license plate capture during the daytime and at night, our <a href=""/hd-lpr"">HD-LPR camera</a> is a perfect choice. This camera has an 8-32mm lens and infrared up to 300' in complete darkness. Most cameras will not capture license plates at night, but our HD-LPR license plate camera fixes that problem and captures license plates up to 75 MPH in complete darkness. After installation and calibration, you will be able to watch the license plates in real time, so it will be easy to determine if the system is well suited for the area. In events where the plate is too small, a camera with a longer range zoom can be used, or the camera can be placed closer; alternately, when the vehicles are moving too fast for reliable capture, it would be recommended to employ an external method to slow vehicles down.</p><p>Platinum CCTV can provide assistance in layout and implementation of your new AVM system with LPR (License Plate Recognition), give us a call for further assistance, demonstration and design for your new system, or upgrade of your current system.</p><p><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">License Plate Recognition</span></p><ul><li>Capture License Plates for vehicles entering and leaving </li><li>Program Alerts when specific vehicles enter or leave (ex-employees, special customers, etc) </li><li>Associate person's picture and data with license plates </li><li>Count vehicles entering or leaving and/or time spent </li><li>Search video based on specific or partial license plates </li></ul><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Take your Security Camera System to the Next Level Today<br>Call us for more information on our LPR software integration<br>630-225-0693</span></p><div class=""c""><hr class=""w80 g""></div></div> ","","LPR Camera - License Plate Recognition System | Platinum CCTV","<META NAME=""DESCRIPTION"" CONTENT=""Shop the latest LPR camera that uses an advanced recognition technology.
