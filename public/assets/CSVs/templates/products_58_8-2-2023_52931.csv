This full-featured NVR software is similar to the software that  <br><br> NetStation open platform software was developed to be implemented on installations consisting from four to hundreds of IP cameras. Full scalability of the software allows you to fine-tune the size of the system to meet customer needs.     <br><br><b> Ongoing technical support and assistance for the DIY Alnet Net Station software is available through Alnet Systems US - (561) 419 6866<br><br></b> Thanks to an extensive network possibilities NetStation software is perfectly suited for surveillance sites scattered across large areas. Constant updates provide the guarantee that you always have at your disposal the latest solutions in line with current market trends. <br><br> Thanks to the open software architecture, the user is free to choose from nearly 1,000 integrated IP cameras from all major manufacturers. The software has been developed for over 7 years and works on about 70 000 installations worldwide, which confirms the high reliability and functionality. <br><br> NetStation software is compatible with the newest IP camera solutions utilizing the HDTV standard. Mega-Pixel IP Cameras which provide video at resolutions, several times greater than PAL/NTSC, which will be a common industry standard in all future installations. The use of Mega-Pixel cameras will change the quality and reliability of CCTV systems. <br><br> The Archive menu in the NetStation system is highly advanced and simultaneously very simple to operate, while reviewing and managing archived video. Recording for each camera channel in the archives creates its own timeline, which clearly shows all the events that occurred to initiate recording. This creates an easy and functional way to localize and view events that occurred. The recordings are shown the same way, using a timeline in the archives. In the archives, as the operator rolls over the timeline, a new preview window is displayed, where fast playback either forward or backward can be initiated. The speed of the playback using the roll over function depends on the speed that the mouse is moved at across the timeline. The Archive Control Panel speed settings provides for functions such as forward/reverse playback with three speed selections, normal, 2x and 4x. Searching for specific motion areas is an advanced feature, which allows for better analyzing of specific areas of recorded video. All events that are found can be marked with bookmarks, for later review, and easy access. Bookmarks can be placed manually in the archives, they can be user initiated, or can be done automatically upon Input Activation. <br><br> The Camera Configuration menu allows for the precise configuration of all camera parameters on all individual cameras. Multilevel menus allow for easy to understand tools that are available for each camera. Motion detection is one of the tools available in the camera configuration, where sensitivity and object masking are essential for each camera, especially for areas with constant motion. <br><br> A specialized photo album stores screenshots of cameras where they can be watermarked, and printed with ease from specific events. The intuitive backup function allows for fast and trouble free ways to backup your archived data to any device e.g. DVD, CD, or network storage. Also options such as backing up to video files e.g. AVI, this way they can be played back on most PC's without additional software having to be installed. <br><br> NetStation allows for the connection of up to 128 PTZ cameras. Controlling of the P/T/Z functions, can either be done manually using the keyboard, joystick, mouse or the on screen control panel. Wide range of supported domes made by several manufacturers, provide great compatibility. Preset Control is an option that can be set manually on PTZ cameras, so specific cameras can monitor larger areas. <br><br> The control of Digital Inputs and Outputs is a seamless process, as a number of programmed events can be programmed to be invoked based on specific inputs. Functions as moving a PTZ camera to a preset, start recording and controlling outputs, can be invoked using a simple input such as a motion sensor, doorbell or any other input. <br><br> Extended sound channel control is a strong feature of the NetStation software. It is possible to record up to 32 audio channels from IP cameras. Recorded sound can easily be browsed in the archives alongside with video recordings. Recording based upon sound detection is useful as it allows to record whole events even when motion is not necessarily detected. Tools for sound detection allow the precise tuning of all parameters available for sound. <br><br> To make any CCTV system function correctly, a precise system of predefined times and actions is required. Included in the NetStation software is a very advanced scheduler with a multitude of options available to control all functions. All camera recorded events, sound events, system alerts and even inputs and outputs can be specified to do specific options such as turn on recording, send output, connect to client, and emailing notifications. The connecting to remote client function is especially useful as no one is able to constantly monitor a CCTV System, and this would automatically show someone what action is happening and where.

These cameras also house high end features such as hardware motion detection, video analytics, 3D noise reduction, Digital Wide Dynamic Range, adjustable IR&nbsp;Cut Filter, 65' Infrared IR&nbsp;night vision, all in a miniature IP66 sealed weatherproof dome housing. Built in 2.8mm lens combined with the 1/3"" CMOS image sensor delivers great wide 100° coverage to ensure full room coverage.</p><p>A cornerstone of our 7th generation IP&nbsp;camera line, builds on previous successful designs to deliver improved video quality, smoother and crisper video with enhanced color and night vision capabilities.</p><p>This camera is most commonly used for interior camera installations. The lightweight aluminum camera housing with polycarbonate dome allows these cameras to mount to any drywall or suspended (drop ceiling) with ease. While these cameras are IP66 rated for outdoor use, generally we recommend our HD-8xx7 or HD-9xx7 model cameras for outdoor use in the elements, as they have improved flat glass lenses instead of the polycarbonate included on this dome.</p><p>This camera delivers night vision with its built-in IR LEDs, so that the camera can see in complete darkness up to 65' maximum. Combined with a mechanical IR cut filter, which automatically slides across to filter IR light during the daytime, which helps to provide beautiful, true colors during daytime hours, while still delivering great IR night vision in black and white during evening hours. The IR&nbsp;filter can be automatically actuated by the built in optical sensor&nbsp;(default) or programmed to switch at a specific time, or remain in a predefined mode.</p><p>The HD-4217 HD&nbsp;IP&nbsp;Camera can be modified with optional backbox for direct wall mount, wall bracket for suspended installation or even pole mount for mounting it directly to a pole.</p><p>This camera now includes FREE&nbsp;AVM&nbsp;Lite software with each camera purchase, which is our industry-leading NVR software that allows you to record from this camera using an enterprise-grade software right out of the box onto your Windows 7, 8.1 or 10 PC or laptop.

278,HD-9447,HD-9447 - 4MP (2688x1520) Outdoor IR Bullet Camera with WDR and motorized zoom lens with auto-focus,Cameras/HD IP Cameras@Cameras/SMART HD IP Cameras,,Platinum CCTV,,0,525,525,0,499,1,10271,5,,4.5,1,0,9/1/2015,,"<div class=""desc""> 			<h2>Description</h2> 			<p>When optimum high definition picture is needed, our HD-9447 cameras are a great selection. These cameras deliver 4 MegaPixel real time video streaming (2688x1520) at smooth 20FPS. This camera takes that even further with a true auto-focus electronic 2.7-12mm motorized lens, which allows you to deliver a wide field of view when needed (up to ~110°)&nbsp;or a zoom view when required (down to ~30°).  Unlike many zoom style cameras, this camera has a true auto-focus lens that will automatically adjust (not a memorized stepped focus) for clearer, crisper images.</p> 			<p>The HD-9447 model camera is our latest 7th generation HD&nbsp;IP&nbsp;Camera, building on previous technologies to deliver better picture quality, this camera comes fully loaded with exceptional features, including true 120dB WDR, PoE, Electronic Zoom, 3D Noise Reduction, Array type SMART&nbsp;IR&nbsp;LEDs with up to 150' night vision, adjustable IR cut filter and video analytics, all housed in an IP66 rated weatherproof armored bullet housing.</p> 			<p>In order to deliver the optimum quality night vision, this camera combines an extremely low light 0.01 Lux CMOS image sensor with true Wide Dynamic Range (WDR)&nbsp;and a fully adjustable IR&nbsp;cut filter and SMART&nbsp;IR&nbsp;array LEDs.  These features all combine to provide the clearest, brightest picture even in complete darkness up to 150' away in complete darkness.  The true wide dynamic range helps brighten up darker areas of the picture to compensate for backlight conditions, and more importantly to boost darker areas at night.  Unlike digital wide dynamic that uses gamma adjustment to boost darker areas and produces more static or noise, this camera has true WDR that combines long and short exposure times to combine into a single frame with optimum clarity in all areas of the picture.  The completely adjustable IR&nbsp;cut filter allows you to set the lighting threshold to begin allowing IR light into the image sensor, as well as the delay time to reduce or eliminate ""stutter"" that is common with IR&nbsp;cut filters.  Possibly the best night vision feature of the HD-9447 camera, is the powerful SMART Array LEDs, which brighten and dim illumination dependent on the scene to deliver the best quality and coverage.  These powerful array type LEDs can deliver night vision in complete darkness even up to 100 feet.</p> 			<p>The bullet design housing is optimal for night vision, as it has a completely isolated glass cover, preventing IR light from reflecting back into the lens.  This fixes the problem that exists in many IR dome cameras, where bleed-over IR&nbsp;light can reflect around in the lens and wash out the image.</p> 			<p>This camera is very easy to connect, with built-in PoE (Power over Ethernet)&nbsp;support. Just run a single CAT-5 or CAT-6 network cable to your camera from any supported PoE switch. This one cable will power up the camera and connect it to the network so you can record from your PC or NVR.</p> 			<p>This camera includes FREE&nbsp;AVM&nbsp;Lite software with each camera purchase, which is our industry-leading NVR software that allows you to record from this camera using an enterprise-grade software right out of the box onto your Windows 7 or 8.1 PC or laptop. It also includes free remote access software, allowing you to connect in and view your camera securely over the internet from iPhone, Android, PC, Mac, Windows&nbsp;Phone and more.  <a title=""Learn more about included AVM Lite software"" href=""/whyavm"" target=""_blank"">Find out more about our AVM&nbsp;sotware</a>.</p> 			<h3>Features</h3> 			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Pro-Grade bullet camera delivers great quality video for home and business.</p> 			<ul> 				<li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HD 4&nbsp;MegaPixel Video quality</span> (2688x1520 Resolution)		</li><li>4.0 MegaPixel CMOS Image Sensor			</li><li>H.264+ Video Compression = smaller file size 				</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">True Auto-Focus lens for best clarity</span> 				</li><li>Dual Stream H.264/MJPEG  				</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Wide 110° - 30° Zoom viewing angle</span> for better coverage 				</li><li>3D Digital Noise Reduction  				</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Infrared night vision</span> up to 150' in pitch black conditions	 				</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">True WDR&nbsp;function for better day and night vision</span> 				</li><li>3-axis adjustment allows mounting on ceiling or wall 				</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">up to 30 fps video</span> for smooth clear picture				</li><li>PoE Support - run just a single CAT-5 to the camera from PoE Switch 				</li><li>Weatherproof IP66 housing			</li><li>Optional weatherproof backbox available				</li><li>ONVIF 2.0 Compliant - Works with most NVR Software  				</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Free AVM Lite NVR Software</span> for recording of up to 4 cameras included	 				<h3></h3> 			</li></ul> 		</div>           ","HD-9447, 4 MegaPixel, 4MP, HD, IP camera, AVM, AVM Lite, Night vision, indoor, outdoor, bullet, business security, home security, electronic zoom, 4x, optical zoom, auto-focus, motorized",0,assets/images/products/cameras/hd-9446/thumbnails/hd-9446_1_thumbnail.jpg,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-9446/HD-9446_1.png,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-9446/HD-9446_2.png,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-9446/HD-9446_3.jpg,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-9446/HD-9446_4.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/v/dLDbqKJYiuA?rel=0,"NETCAM,PoE4,PoE4G",,0,HD-9447 4.0 MegaPixel HD IR Long Range Bullet Camera with Motorized Zoom Lens,Heavy Duty Bullet camera housing protects the camera from the elements in any water,SMART IR delivers excellent quality night vision with True WDR and SMART IR capabilities,"This camera has built in weatherproof RJ-45, Aux Power, Audio input and output and Alarm I/O connections",HD Long Range Infrared 4x Zoom 4.0 MegaPixel HD IP Bullet Camera with SMART Array IR Nightvision and PoE,"<META NAME=""DESCRIPTION"" CONTENT=""4 Megapixel HD IP Bullet camera with array LEDs, Long range IR, motorized zoom lens audio input and alarm input/output""> <META NAME=""ABSTRACT"" CONTENT=""Outdoor Long-Range SMART IR bullet HD IP Camera""> <META NAME=""KEYWORDS"" CONTENT=""4mp, infrared, IR, SMART IR, electronic zoom, motorized zoom, auto-focus, HD-9447, HD9447, night vision, business security, outdoor, weatherproof""> ",,,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Michael,8/19/2020 11:05,,,,,,,," <div class=""desc""><h2>Video Clips from this camera</h2><p>The following video clips can be downloaded in full resolution allowing you to see the full quality of the camera.

Your security camera system should not be a weakness in your network security. Unfortunately, often, that is the case. That is why our AVM system is highly recommended. It is a PC based solution, which is much more difficult for hackers to enter these days, as most of the hacks are now designed for embedded devices. &nbsp;The PC based solution is also easier to patch and update, to keep up with today's standards of security.</p><div class=""c""></div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Infrared Night Vision</h4><h5>See everything, even with no light</h5><div class=""c""></div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Standalones/DVR-98xx/DVR-98xx-6.jpg"" alt=""2K Resolution Infrared Night Vision cameras"" border=""0""><p><br><br>Most of what you want to see, especially with outdoor cameras will occur at night. &nbsp;This is why all of our cameras have Infrared&nbsp;LEDs to illuminate the area in front of the camera with an invisible infrared light that the camera will be able to see, but perpetrators will not.

For instance, if you want to know everyone that purchased a cheeseburger today, you will be able to search, get a list and click on each transaction to see the video. Or perhaps you think someone is abusing the discounts, you can search for a discounted transaction, then watch the video. &nbsp;This upgrade is an excellent add on for retail and food service industries.</p><div class=""c""></div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Most Powerful Scheduling</h4><h5>Control everything that happens</h5><div class=""c""></div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_alarm.jpg"" alt=""2K&nbsp;Resolution IP&nbsp;Camera system with text and email alerts"" border=""0""><p><br><br>The core of our AVM software, is an enhanced scheduling engine.

Our AVM system is a different kind of device, running a full operating system, which is easier to keep up to date to protect it against attacks. Our AVM system is also fully compatible with secure VPN access, making it the obvious choice for IT departments that are serious about security.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>See in the Dark</h4><h5>See what happens even when there is no light</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Standalones/DVR-98xx/DVR-98xx-6.jpg"" alt=""2K IP cameras with extreme infrared night vision and WDR"" border=""0""><p><br><br>Many bad things happen after the sun goes down.

For this reason, we recommend never exposing an IP camera to the outside internet directly, and always recommend using our AVM systems instead of embedded devices for recording.

This light allows these cameras to see even in complete darkness up to 100' depending on model.

The AVM software is compatible with virtually all IP cameras manufactured, including Platinum CCTV cameras, HIKVision, Dahua, Axis, ACTi, Vivotek and many more. This NVR recorder is also compatible with generic ONVIF IP cameras as well. When deciding on hardware for your home or business security camera system, it is important to know that the NVR recorder is the most important part of the system. The NVR determines the features and functionality of your camera system.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Find your video in seconds not hours!</h4><h5>Fastest access to video means you use your cameras more!</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Playback.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Our MidNVR recorders include our latest AVM (Advanced Video Management) software for IP camera recording. This software allows industry-leading access to your recorded video, allowing you to scan through days, weeks or months of video visually to find exactly what happened in a matter of seconds instead of hours. This single feature alone makes the NVR recorder worth more than other recorders on the market. Our customers use their security camera footage for more than just a break-ins or vandalism. They now can use their video to see everything that happened in the course of a day in a matter of seconds. This may not be the only feature of this system that makes it better than the rest, but it is certainly one of the most important.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Real-Time Remote Camera Access</h4><h5>View cameras from all your devices</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/Remote_Access.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Our home and business systems have been accessible from cell phones from long before the first iPhone was released. We even had the ability to watch security cameras back in the days of the flip phone. As technology evolved, so did our capabilities for remote access. We were one of the first to allow security camera footage from an iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Symbian phone and more. This allows our clients a highly-evolved and advanced level app that permits them to see everything that is happening in real-time from anywhere in the world.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Support for all Major IP Cameras</h4><h5>Compatible with most IP camera brands/models</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM-IP-Cameras.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br><br>This MidNVR with AVM is compatible with virtually every brand IP camera on the market, as well as generic cameras through ONVIF and RTSP protocols. Major brand IP cameras like ACTi, Arecont Vision, Axis, Sanyo, Bosch, Platinum CCTV, Ganz, HIKVision, Dahua, Everfocus, Samsung and more are fully integrated into the software for easy installation and operation of the cameras. These cameras will stream securely into the AVM NVR, which records from the cameras, and serves the video up for remote access from PCs, MACs, tablets, Androids and iPhones.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Remote Video Recording</h4><h5>Keep backup copies of your video</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM-Remote-Record.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br>If you are worried that someone will break in and steal your video, worry no more. This AVM system comes complete with our CMS4 software, allowing you to conduct a remote recording over the internet to an off-site location automatically in real time. This is different from Cloud-based recording which is very limited in the bandwidth and resolution of main recording. With our AVM software, you can recording the primary full resolution or secondary reduced resolution remotely in real-time, allowing you to custom-tailor your offsite video to match the quality and bandwidth you require and have available. This means that you can always have a backup recording of all of your video, even if your recorder is stolen. Basic embedded-style recorders do not have this capability.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Ultimate Security</h4><h5>Know even if someone TRIES to access your cameras</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Login_Alert.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br><br>Security cameras have gotten a bad name in the news for being hacked. This generally happens with low-cost security camera options like embedded DVRs and NVRs. With our AVM system, it runs on the latest Windows 10 platform, allowing the latest in updated security features, while also offering thousands of times more processing capabilities than simple embedded NVRs. Our PC-based recording platforms can even be configured to let you know every time someone even attempts to access your security cameras. This way, you can receive a text message or email, even before access to your cameras has occured. This is far better security than offered by more simple NVR recorders. SSL encryption for video and login information now supported for even more security. Trust your indoor home or business security cameras to a system that lets you know what is happening all the time.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Stay in touch with Alerts!</h4><h5>Motion Text Alerts, Alarm Integration and MORE</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Alerts.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Integrate your home or business security camera system to a level you never even dreamed possible. Most security camera systems state that they can send you email or text alerts. The problem is that they issue alerts based on video motion (like RING, Nest, etc.) and these methods of alerting are prone to extreme false alerting which means that you will disable the alerts very quickly. Our AVM system is compatible with security cameras that have built-in VCA analytics events so that you can receive alerts only when a person or vehicle enters a certain area. These cameras, like our 7th Generation HD IP cameras, allow you to really receive intelligent alerting from your security camera system with complex schedules and events. If you want even more integration, then connect an alarm integration module to receive alerts and events when your alarm system is tripped, alarmed, etc. The base of a truly smart home or business is the brains. This MidNVR recorder with AVM software is the best platform to control and collect all of your information in one place. Our systems go far beyond simply traditional security cameras.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>POS System Integration</h4><h5>Optional POS System Integration for Businesses</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_POS.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p>Upgrade your security camera system to incorporate POS system integration. Our AVM system supports most POS systems, and allows you not only to view the transactions in real time as they are occurring, but also to search transactions based on clear text data. This is because the transaction information is stored inside a database, allowing you better control of how to search and find transactions. This is just another way our AVM system is capable of becoming a valuable asset to your business.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>More Powerful Scheduling</h4><h5>Control everything that happens</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_alarm.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br><br>Built into our AVM software, even the core of its operations is a powerful and flexible scheduling engine. This allows the software to work seamlessly with all of your business and home automation tasks. Schedule recording, events, alerts for motion or VCA events and much more with a complex scheduler that helps to ensure that you can receive alerts only when you deem them necessary. This scheduling capability ensures that you will always be able to reconfigure your system to suit your needs and lifestyle.</p><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>An Expert on your shoulder</h4><h5>Industry Leading Technical Support</h5><div class=""c"">&nbsp;</div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Standalones/DVR-98xx/DVR-98xx-8.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0""><p><br><br>Our technicians are highly trained and ready to assist you in the setup and operation of your system.

This camera can be used as a standalone device, providing measurement and reminder for persons entering, or it can alternately be used in combination with door locks or other access control devices to even prevent access to persons with skin temperature higher than a predetermined limit (current CDC recommendation is 100.4°F). These cameras can be used with Weiand style access control cards in place of existing card readers, and are even capable of using facial detection. This camera is fast, and provides temperature detection down to 0.2 seconds and can detect temperature on persons between 1-6 feet away from the camera, helping to prevent contamination associated with touching surfaces. These thermal cameras are sure to help smaller businesses provide an additional later of scanning and safety for their clients and employees by taking the skin temperature of each person as they are entering the facility, as well as keep persons without a mask or with an elevated skin temperature from being able to access your building until they receive further screening by personnel using an FDA-cleared thermometer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Viruses-350x301.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Fever is one of the first symptoms of many viruses including Ebola, Coronaviruses and the Flu"" title=""Fever is an early symptom of many viruses including Ebola, COVID-19 and Flu viruses"" border=""0""><p>With this camera in place for your small business, restaurant, day spa, salon, office, doctor's office, dentist, small warehouse or any other business, you will be able to identify persons body temperature without having to touch them, then isolate them for further examination. This camera is great for smaller businesses because it fits into tight budgets and can be used with access control devices in order to simply prevent access to any persons that do not have normal body temp and/or are wearing a mask. This camera speeds up screening processes with body temperature readings accurate to ±0.5°C and has an audible and visual alert to let people know if their temperature is too high, and can remind them about their mask.</p><p>This camera works with our AVM NVR software to integrate this body temperature sensing camera with the rest of your security cameras, this allows you to get great facial video of persons entering your facility and a record of their body temperature. <a title=""Learn more about included AVM Lite software"" href=""/whyavm"" target=""_blank"">Find out more about our AVM sotware</a>.</p><p>This thermal body-temperature sensing camera is great to help pre-screen in order to assist in identifying persons with an elevated body temperature without contacting them directly during initial triage.<br><br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size:90%; line-height:normal;"">This thermal camera is not designed or intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or condition.

Most states have informed businesses that they should be taking the temperatures of every employee and customer as they are entering the facility. Having an employee manually taking temperatures is a costly and difficult proposition for small businesses. This camera is an ideal solution as a standalone wall or floor mounted (with optional floor bracket) camera that allows the rapid prescreening of individuals as they are attempting to enter the business. When used in conjunction with a complete access control system, this camera can deny access to individuals with elevated skin temperature (which could be an indicator of a fever) as well as remind people to put on their face masks or even prevent entry without a mask. When persons with elevated skin temperature are encountered, it is recommended that you perform further screening with an FDA contact thermometer to confirm elevated body temp prior to permitting access to your facility. Also built-in to this innovative camera, is facial detection technology that can optionally be employed to permit access only to individuals, or permit access based on IC access control card (must be used with access control devices and/or locks to prevent/deny access).</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Day-Spa-350x233.jpg"" width=""350"" alt=""Salons and Day Spas really benefit from thermal body temp cameras scanning for elevated skin temperatures and face masks on entry"" title=""Day Spa and salong Thermal body temp sensing camera with mask detection for access control to help prevent the spread of COVID-19"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spas and Salons</span> are one type of business that clearly will have many people coming through the doors, as post-lockdown in every country many of us need our haircuts and other services. These businesses will clearly get a great benefit by being able to scan the body temperature of each person as they are entering the building. In the case of these businesses, it is impossible to keep social distancing while delivering many of their needed services. This is why it is one of our most popular cameras for day spas, medical spas and salons that are trying to open back up after the end of stay-at-home orders and other quarnantine efforts in their locales. In some cases, spas are using these cameras to prevent access to the building (in conjunction with electric door locks in vestibule areas), in others it is used as a standalone device with the floor bracket to take temperatures and alert the person and receptionist if people are entering with a high body temperature. It is really nice to have the mask detection and reminder built-in to this camera as well, because it reduces the need to have employees reminding customers that they need to put on their mask.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Restaurant-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Restaurants and Bars clearly can benefit by being able to quickly take temperatures and see if masks are used during entry"" title=""Restaurant Body Temp sensing and mask detection camera for access control."" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Restaurants and Bars</span> also are an area that immediately benefit from these cameras. Many restaurants and bars already have vestibule areas that can easily be adapted to permit access only when people entering do not have an elevated skin temperature and can also provide a reminder or deny access to people who are not wearing a proper face mask. In the future, the mask requirement can be turned off easily when requirements for wearing masks in public are relaxed. Restaurants are all going to great lengths to be ready to open back up for customers to dine in, these thermal body temp measuring cameras with mask detection are the perfect way to add an easy and high tech way to comply with state and local recommendations, while ensuring that your patrons feel safe to return to your facility.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Hospitals-350x233.jpg"" width=""350px"" alt=""Hospitals more than anyone need to have a way to quickly screen individuals for an elevated body temperature as people are entering"" title=""Doctor and Dentist office Body temp fever sensing camera with mask detection"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Doctors Office's and Dental Offices</span> are beginning to open up again around the world, and are looking for ways to not overwhelm their staff while showing their clients that they are doing everything they can to ensure the safety and health of their patients. These thermal cameras (elevated skin temp) are a great way to provide the needed pre-screening of individuals entering the property without adding extra steps for already overwhlemed staff. These cameras can even ben used outside of the entry door (in the hallway) of many offices in conjunction with automatic door locks to help prevent the entry of individuals that have high skin temperatures until they are further screened by your personnel with an FDA-cleared thermometer to determine if they have a fever (elevated body temperature).<br>Note: this cameras is not a medical device and is not designed to diagnose or treat any virus or disease.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Small-Business-350x262.jpg"" alt=""SMB small and medium businesses of all types can benefit from preventing access to persons with fevers.

They can be mounted near the entryway and even optionally wired into the automatic doors to prevent access to persons that are not wearing masks as they should be, or have elevated skin temp. Elevated skin temperatures should be verified with a secondary step using an FDA-cleared contact thermometer. This automates the process that is already in play in these essential businesses, to help ensure that all personnel and clients have been scanned for body temperature and are wearing their masks as they enter the facility.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Nursing-Home-350x245.jpg"" alt=""Nursing homes and assisted living facilities are key areas where it is important to be able protect family members to prevent infection of residents."" title=""Nursing homes would greatly benefit from thermal cameras that scan patrons for buey temperature for signs of viral infection"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities</span> have been riddled with infection, and the residents of these facilities are the most susceptible to complications from viruses. This is why during the coronavirus pandemic, many of these facilities cut off all ties with the outside world. Unfortunately, still workers in many instances have become infected and brought the virus into the facility ultimately infecting many of the residents. Because an elevated body temperature is one of the earliest symptoms of many viruses, many of these facilities have implemented protocols to examine body temperatures of individuals as they enter the facility. These cameras are popular to connect in the vestibule or entry area of these facilities in order to help prevent access by persons that have elevated skin temperatures and/or are not wearing masks to help protect residents and staff. Once elevated skin temperatures are found, we recommend follow up with an FDA-cleared thermometer to verify elevated body temperature or fever prior to individuals being permitted access.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Car-Dealer-350x234.jpg"" alt=""Car Dealers have many customers entering facilities which can quickly and easily be scanned by skin temp measuring cameras"" title=""Body temp scanning cameras will greatly help car dealers by allowing them to see if patrons have a fever before they enter vehicles"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Car Dealers</span> have great numbers of people cycling through to examine and even test drive the different vehicles. With the new coronavirus and possible future viral threats, operations must change to keep all their employees and customers safe. One great way to accomplish this in a way that has minimal visual and time impact on clients and staff, can be the use of methods of screening individuals for elevated body temperatures. Our thermal cameras can be permanently mounted in entry ways so that they can provide alerts or even bar access to individuals without proper PPE or with elevated body temperatures. Use this camera with our AVM software to alert key personnel in the facility so that they can address the situation or take other precautions.</p><div class=""clear"">&nbsp;</div><br><img class=""l"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/Cameras/Thermal/Apartments-350x233.jpg"" alt=""Apartment buildings and high rises can easily scan visitors and residents for fever prior to entering the facility"" title=""Scan residents and visitors to apartments and condos with thermal cameras prior to entering the building where many could be exposed"" width=""350px"" border=""0""><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Apartment Buildings, Condos and High Rises</span> all have many people living in close proximity to one another, with common areas of contact.

These cameras have various range of infrared night vision, but all include our 7th generation video processor with WDR&nbsp;(wide dynamic range) to best brighten darker areas of the view, giving someone no place to hide, even at night.</p><div class=""c""></div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Be Alert!</h4><h5>Text and Email Alerts keep you aware</h5><div class=""c""></div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_Alerts.jpg"" alt=""Inteagrate your IP cameras with alarm sensors for ultimate alerting"" border=""0""><p><br><br>Optional upgrade allows you to integrate your new AVM security camera system with your alarm sensors or alarm system. Don't have an alarm system?&nbsp;&nbsp;No Problem. Any NO/NC sensors can be connected to our DI/DO&nbsp;card in order to send you email or text alerts to keep you aware of what is happening at your property. This level of integration can be a life saver when it comes to home or business properties, providing you with complex alerts when doors are opened after hours, pipes are close to freezing, water is in areas it shouldn't be and much more. </p><div class=""c""></div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>POS Overlay Integration</h4><h5>Optional POS System Integration for Businesses</h5><div class=""c""></div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_POS.jpg"" alt=""POS&nbsp;Overlay for HD&nbsp;IP&nbsp;Cameras"" border=""0""><p><br><br>Connecting your camera system to your POS terminals optionally can assist you in capturing transaction data so that you can watch what is transacted along with the video, but also because it stores in in a plain text format, you can even search for video based on the transaction information. For instance, if you want to know everyone that purchased a cheeseburger today, you will be able to search, get a list and click on each transaction to see the video. Or perhaps you think someone is abusing the discounts, you can search for a discounted transaction, then watch the video. &nbsp;This upgrade is an excellent add on for retail and food service industries.</p><div class=""c""></div><hr class=""w80 g""><h4>Most Powerful Scheduling</h4><h5>Control everything that happens</h5><div class=""c""></div><img class=""r"" src=""../../assets/images/Products/AVM/AVM_alarm.jpg"" alt=""2K&nbsp;Resolution IP&nbsp;Camera system with text and email alerts"" border=""0""><p><br><br>The core of our AVM software, is an enhanced scheduling engine. This provides you with the ability to schedule complex alerts that can be based on camera motion, signal loss, alarm inputs, analytics alerts, system events and much more. You can even layer multiple events simultaneously to ensure when you get an alert it is something you want to see. Use the scheduler to control lights and other devices based on any event with optional IO&nbsp;card.

When combined with our AVM (Advanced Video Management) System and CMS4 client software, this means you can even search for vehicles by license plate, receive alerts when specific plates enter or exit view and much more. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw3B0o0KYdI&amp;list=PLqS0N8sNe7FX_PGvvqg08_TeNHcreZuMK&amp;index=3""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Check out the combination of our HD-LPR-ANPR camera with our AVM Software here.</span></a> Our HD-LPR-ANPR camera is a specialized IP based camera with fast 30fps framerate to help ensure that you capture clearer vehicle images and license plates for vehicles travelling up to 70 MPH. This 1080P Full HD resolution camera comes equipped with an 8-32mm electronic motorized zoom lens to help custom-tailor the width of view for optimum license plate capture, DarkFighter Ultra-Low Light technology with headlight compensation capabilities and up to 300 foot infrared night vision. These cameras are a great addition to any business security camera system, providing you with excellent non-blurred high definition video to provide not only great license plate capture, but also details on vehicles that would be missed by other cameras due to higher vehicle speeds.</p><p>When it comes to IP security cameras, resolution is not the only factor that needs to be considered. In fact, when it comes to license plates on moving vehicles, often the higher resolution 2K (4MP) and 4K (8MP) cameras are not the best choice. These cameras have lower framerates, and have greater smearing than a specific license plate camera. While many 2K and 4K cameras may grab license plates when vehicles are stopped, once they pick up speed, often they do not function well.</p><p>This HD-LPR model license plate recognition camera provides great color video during the daytime at up to 30FPS, and then switches to black and white at night with infrared up to 300 feet. At night, the video from these cameras appear as a solid black screen, but when a vehicle passes through, it will see the headlights and license plate or tail lights and license plate. This is due to the fact that these cameras have to be tuned to reduce the overall brightness to prevent glare that occurs on most cameras when IR lights reflect off of US license plates.</p><p>These cameras include our 7th Generation video processing chip providing superior video quality with up to 16Mbps bit rate and up to 30FPS to provide blur free video coverage even on vehicles traveling up to 70 MPH. These cameras also include our latest artificial intelligence with VCA, when combined with supported NVRs like our AVM (Advanced Video Management) NVRs and NVR software, will allow for super fast searching for vehicles that pass through the cameras view, so you don't have to playback days of video to find the vehicles that move through.</p><p>The HD-LPR-ANPR HD IP Camera can be enhanced with optional backbox for direct wall mount allowing cables to be concealed, corner bracket or even pole mount for mounting it directly to a pole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Features</h3><p> This Feature-Rich license plate capture camera delivers great quality video for business applications where license plate capture is needed.</p><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HD 1080P Resolution Video quality</span> (1920x1080 Resolution)</li><li>2.0 MegaPixel CMOS Image Sensor </li><li>Smooth 30 FPS frame rate for smooth video </li><li>H.264+ Video Compression = smaller file size </li><li>Dual Stream H.264/MJPEG </li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Electronically Adjustable 8-32mm motorized zoom lens</span></li><li>3D Digital Noise Reduction </li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Infrared night vision</span> up to 300' in pitch black conditions </li><li>Armored Bullet housing </li><li>Glass front with isolated lenses for better night vision </li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DWDR function for better day and night vision</span></li><li>3-axis adjustment allows mounting on ceiling or wall </li><li>PoE Support - run just a single CAT-5 to the camera from PoE Switch </li><li>IP67 Weatherproof housing </li><li>Optional corner mount bracket &amp; backbox available </li><li>ONVIF 2.0 Compliant - Works with most NVR Software </li></ul></div>    ","HD-LPR, ANPR, OCR, LPR, 2 MegaPixel, 1080P, HD, IP camera, AVM, AVM Lite, Night vision, indoor, outdoor, bullet, business security, license plate, LPR, VCA, electronic zoom, optical zoom, auto-focus, motorized",0,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-LPR/HD-LPR-1-thumb.jpg,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-LPR/HD-LPR-1.jpg,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-LPR/HD-LPR-2.jpg,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-LPR/HD-LPR-3.jpg,assets/images/Products/Cameras/HD-LPR/HD-LPR-4.jpg,,"NETCAM,PoE4G,PoE8",,0,HD-LPR-ANPR Camera for License Plate Capture up to 7 miles per hour,This 1080P HD IP license plate camera is ideal for any installation where license plate capture is required with ANPR technology,This sleek new LPR camera with ANPR technology is ideal for businesses with 8-32mm zoom lens,"HD-LPR-ANPR Weatherproof RJ-45, alarm and audio input connectors",HD-LPR-ANPR License Plate Capture HD IP Camera w/ANPR Tech,"<META NAME=""DESCRIPTION"" CONTENT=""This License plate capture camera is ideal for any business where capturing license plates of vehicles is important.

This reduces false alerting even further, so that you can rely on your cameras to alert you when there is something you need to see without the pesky false-alerts that other cameras deliver. This new filter can be employed to provide you with text or email alerts during certain times of day/days of the week when a vehicle or person enters an area they should not be in.</p><p>The HD-8418AI HD IP Camera can be enhanced with optional backbox for direct wall mount allowing cables to be conceiled, wall bracket for suspended installation or even pole mount for mounting it directly to a pole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Features</h3><p> This Feature-Rich SMART HD IP Turret camera delivers great quality video for home and business with advanced alerting capabilities.</p><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HD 2K Resolution Video quality</span> (2560x1440 Resolution) </li><li>4.0 MegaPixel CMOS Image Sensor </li><li>Enhanced A.I.

It provides 1080P resolution video in color during the daytime with Infrared IR nightvision at night when light levels drop.</p><p>The HD-8219 camera is our NDAA Approved mid-resolution model of our turret-style cameras, providing up to 1080P resolution video video with a 2.8mm super wide angle lens and crisp, clear infrared night vision using IR LEDs for optimum quality during the daytime and at night. </p><p>Even though this turret camera is designed with outdoor installations in mind, it fits into any environment due to its smaller size. This camera has an easy to adjust 3 axis housing, allowing this camera to be mounted either on an overhang, wall or even sitting on top of a parapet. The front of this security camera has 2 isolated glass lenses, one for the HD lens and the other for the IR array LED. Isolating these 2 lenses ensures that no matter what happens, you will always have the best possible clarity, both in daytime and at night. This makes this camera an optimal choice for any outdoor camera installations especially.</p><p>The fact that these cameras are just as lightweight as their dome counterparts, and glass lenses for durability, make these cameras also a popular choice for interior camera installations, especially in areas where humidity, moisture or dust persist: warehouses, restaurant kitchens, manufacturing facilities and much more. </p><p>This camera delivers night vision with its built-in IR LEDs, so that the camera can see in complete darkness up to 100' maximum distance. These LEDs are combined with an IR cut filter, this automatically slides across to filter IR light during the daytime, which helps to provide beautiful, true colors during daytime hours by blocking excess IR light, while still delivering great IR night vision in black and white mode during evening hours. The IR filter can be automatically actuated by the built in optical sensor (default) or programmed to switch at a specific time, or remain in a predefined mode.</p><p>The HD-8219 HD IP Camera can be enhanced with optional backbox for direct wall mount allowing cables to be conceiled, wall bracket for suspended installation or even pole mount for mounting it directly to a pole.</p><p>We recommend our <a href=""https://platinumcctv.com/nvr-cctv.html"">NDAA Approved AVM NVR software or AVM NVR recorders </a>combined with these NDAA Approved IP cameras, for best picture quality. </p>  <h3>Features</h3><p> This Feature-Rich turret camera delivers great quality video for home and business from a small housing.</p><ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HD 1080P Resolution Video quality</span> (1920x1080 Resolution) </li> <li>2.0 MegaPixel CMOS Image Sensor </li> <li>H.264 Video Compression = smaller file size </li> <li>Dual Stream H.265/H.264</li> <li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Wide ~100° viewing angle</span> for better room coverage </li> <li>3D Digital Noise Reduction </li> <li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Infrared night vision</span> up to 100' in pitch black conditions </li> <li>Small Armor Turret housing </li> <li>Glass front with isolated lenses for better night vision </li> <li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DWDR function for better day and night vision</span></li> <li>3-axis adjustment allows mounting on ceiling or wall </li> <li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20 fps video</span> for smooth clear picture </li> <li>PoE Support - run just a single CAT-5 to the camera from PoE Switch </li> <li>IP66 Weatherproof housing </li> <li>Optional wall mount bracket &amp; backbox available </li> <li>ONVIF 2.0 Compliant - Works with most NVR Software </li></ul></div>    ","HD-8219, HD8219, 2 MegaPixel, 2 MP, 1080P, turret, security camera, surveillance, cctv, IP camera, outdoor camera, indoor camera, infrared, IR, night vision, NDAA",0,assets/images/products/cameras/hd-8xx9/HD-8xx9-1-thumb.png,assets/images/products/cameras/hd-8xx9/HD-8xx9-1.png,assets/images/products/cameras/hd-ip/hd-cable.jpg,assets/images/products/cameras/common/onvif_compliant_500x375.jpg,,,,,0,1080P 2 MegaPixel HD IP NDAA Approved camera with Infrared Night vision,Weatherproof RJ-45 connection for easy installation inside or outside,ONVIF compatible for use with virtually any NVR software or Standalone NVR,,HD-8219 NDAA Approved 2MP 1080P turret security camera,"<META NAME=""DESCRIPTION"" CONTENT=""HD-8219 2 MegaPixel 2k weatherproof turret camera NDAA Approved for Government Installations""> <META NAME=""ABSTRACT"" CONTENT=""2 MegaPixel 1080P high definition turret NDAA Approved camera""> <META NAME=""KEYWORDS"" CONTENT=""HD-8219, HD8219, turret camera, security camera, HD, 1080P, weatherproof, Smart camera, AI, human detection, vehicle detection"">",,,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Michael,7/19/2023 11:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,,,0,,0,0,Ships FREE!,,,8,8,8,0,0,0,,0,,,
