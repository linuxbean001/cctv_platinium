What and how does it work?
Our WiFi cameras are hassle free with simple set-up. All you need is to have access to high speed internet via a wireless 
router. You need not to be a networking expert to use this device; we are at your back to provide you with the whole setup.
 We can even reach straight to your computer system at the location of your camera. Plus there is a scope for setup expansion
 too! Expect for WFDVR-100, our cameras’ connectivity is compatible with each other. New and upgraded models compatible with 
these will be out soon. So you need not replace or change the entire setup each time you want to upgrade. 
The camera is compatible with almost all major brands’ routers, but not the ones with modem functions in a single router and
 mobiles. [NOTE: MAC is NOT compatible]. Therefore you are advised to go through the technical details prior ordering. 
The recorded audio-video is transmitted directly to the connected router. Hence you can watch the video LIVE on you PC or 
smartphone from anywhere you have an access to the internet. This wireless pinhole camera is totally safe and convenient to 
use. Now you need not be a peeping tom or waste your time guessing on your own what might be happening at your place behind
 you. Know from your workplace what your not-yet-adult kid is doing at home or who is going in-and-out of the place of 
utmost importance away from your eyes. You just don’t get to listen to and watch the activities via this WiFi camera, but
 also get to record them in the extensive recording software we provide along! Still want to know more about these cameras?
